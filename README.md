# Modal DOM Manipulation
[Link](http://subhanshuprasad.me/modal-dom-manipulation1/)
This project is a simple web page that demonstrates how to use JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and create a modal window. A modal window is a dialog box that appears on top of the main content and blocks the user from interacting with the rest of the page.
